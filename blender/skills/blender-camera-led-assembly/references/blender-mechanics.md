# Blender State and Animation Mechanics

## Evaluated source state

Activate the relevant scene and view layer, set the intended frame, and update evaluation before measuring world transforms. Newly loaded inactive scenes can expose unevaluated matrices. Activate an animated source at its reference frame before comparing it with a frozen assembly copy. Preserve the source animation and record the selected pose explicitly.

Inspect hierarchy, constraints, drivers, action slots, NLA, shape keys, simulations, modifiers, and shared datablocks before edits. A copied scene must have a persistent user; verify its presence after saving and reopening. Protect other scenes when replacing objects or unlinking shared collections.

## Copies and attachment transforms

Keep native sources intact. Separate evaluated geometry when necessary and preserve materials, UVs, normals, and complete face coverage. Restrict spatial partitioning to an identified surface whose topology has been checked. Applying subdivision independently to cut source meshes can change their boundaries and silhouette.

Compute each part's final local transform from its preserved world transform and the inverse of the final parent transform. Place the controller at the actual attachment, compensate the child's local transform, and measure the assembled result after evaluation. Copy original transform components, rotation mode, delta transforms, and parent inverse directly when preserving an existing hierarchy; unnecessary matrix decomposition can introduce error.

Nonuniform parent scale combined with rotation can produce shear that an isolated transform cannot represent. Preserve that hierarchy or bake the complete affine transform into temporary geometry with correctly transformed normals. Verify the chosen route against the source, including dependent particles.

## Animation ownership

In Blender 5.1, address the channelbag belonging to the animated datablock's action_slot handle. Camera data, shape keys, and objects can occupy different slots. animation_data_clear followed by key insertion can reconnect an existing action containing old keys. Clear only owned channels in the correct slot or assign a fresh owned action, then inspect the actual curves.

Retiming must update key times and both handle times consistently, together with event metadata and dependent visibility. Preserve deliberate easing. Smooth sampled trajectories need continuous tangents through intermediate keys; repeated easing at every sample can introduce pauses. Check settled intervals for returning scale, deformation, or visibility keys.

Animate hide_render and hide_viewport consistently with constant visibility transitions. Hiding an Empty does not reliably hide its children. Also inspect hide_set, collection exclusions, and modifier visibility. Keep required constraint targets evaluated.

When permanently superseding a renderable object in the revision, remove its owned visibility F-curves or key a constant hidden state across the full shot. Clearing keyframe points while leaving an empty visibility channel is not proof that a directly assigned flag will persist through file reload and render evaluation. Check the sequential render, including other actions, drivers, and NLA that can restore it.

## Instances and memory

Inspect evaluated instances even when a procedural root has no mesh faces. Copy instance identity and matrices while iterating; do not retain transient depsgraph instance wrappers. Copy metadata arrays into independent plain values before removing their owning datablocks.

Share animated prototypes when that preserves per-instance timing and construction. Duplicating expensive procedural evaluation for every visible instance can make a scene unusable. Validate the actual evaluated repetitions and their final transforms before expanding the method.

## Geometric reveal and flexible detail

Solid appearance must change geometry, transforms, or visibility. Shader transparency alone is insufficient. For Geometry Nodes reveal, verify attribute space, modifier order, face selection, and the appearance of open boundaries. An origin offset is not a general substitute for evaluating a moving hierarchy's coordinate system.

Open-surface normal recalculation can orient disconnected terrain patches inconsistently. Compare copied face winding and normals with the native source; for a verified heightfield, upward-facing surface normals provide an additional check. Do not force this rule onto overhangs or closed meshes. After welding, re-evaluate orientation and smoothing. Preserve source corner or vertex normals on aligned temporary fragments when a later handoff would otherwise create visible shading seams.

Flexible temporary copies can use shape keys or suitable deformation modifiers. Deform regions consistently with their thickness, seams, attachments, and support; a soft material on a rigid backing does not make the whole assembly flexible. Curve reveal can control a continuous winding path. Confirm that the evaluated shape returns to its undeformed state before handoff; a zero controller value alone is insufficient evidence.

Particle and hair behavior must be checked in sequential rendering. Cached strands can lag behind otherwise correct moving copies. If temporary geometric strands are required, derive them from the existing paths, preserve their radii after transforms, and return the untouched native emitter only after seating. A nominal hair length may not describe edited paths. Remove all temporary strands in the final state.

## Viewport integrity

Preserve the user's viewport overlays and unrelated display settings. Use a valid view and region context for viewport capture, and inspect the resulting image. A Workbench render has its own display profile and must be evaluated separately from UI capture.
